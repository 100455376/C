    // ADDRESS: When a variable is created in C, a memory address is assigned to the variable. -> The memory address is the location of where the variable is stored on the computer. -> When we assign a value to the variable, it is stored in this memory address. -> To access it, use the reference operator (&), and the result represents where the variable is stored:
    n=21;
    printf("\n%p", &n); // Outputs 0x7ff7bfeff104
    // Note: &n is often called a "pointer". A pointer basically stores the memory address of a variable as its value. To print pointer values, we use the %p format specifier.
    
    // POINTERS: variable that stores the memory address of another variable as its value. -> A pointer variable points to a data type (like int) of the same type, and is created with the * operator. -> The address of the variable you are working with is assigned to the pointer:
    
    int age = 21;
    int* ptr = &age; // Here the * sign creates a pointer variable (can also declare as int *ptr)
    printf("\n%d", age); // Outputs 21
    printf("\n%p", &age); // Outputs 0x7ff7bfeff0b8
    printf("\n%p", ptr); // Outputs 0x7ff7bfeff0b8
    printf("\n%d", *ptr); // Outputs 21 // Here the * sign acts as dereference operator
    // Example explained: Create a pointer variable with the name ptr, that points to an int variable (myAge). Note that the type of the pointer has to match the type of the variable you're working with (int in our example). -> Use the & operator to store the memory address of the myAge variable, and assign it to the pointer. -> Now, ptr holds the value of myAge's memory address. -> You can also get the value of the variable the pointer points to, by using the * operator (the dereference operator):

If you are familiar with data structures like lists, trees and graphs, you should know that pointers are especially useful for implementing those.

    printf("%lu", sizeof(myInt)); // 4, compiler reserves 4 bytes of memory for each array element, meaning that the entire array takes up 16 bytes (4*4) of memory storage
